# Eye-Movement

## Description
With this project, two eyes will appear on screen. As the user moves their cursor across the screen, the eyes will follow!

## How to Run
Open the html file, and the eyes will appear! From there, just move your cursor around the screen, and the eyes will do the rest!

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I think an interesting update to make would be to update the appearance of the eyes! (Change the pupil color, add eyelashes, eyeshadow, etc.)

## License Information
This project was made for the MIT XPro coding bootcamp, all updates were made by me.
